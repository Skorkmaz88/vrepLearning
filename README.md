# vrepLearning

Simple way demonstrate, deep neural networks for robotic control usage with V-rep. System consists Encoder and Decoder networks. Showing exponential changes in neuron numbers in a neural network can lead the networks to learn most significant joints as parallel to infant motor skills learning, yielded a poster publication.

Code consists two parts;

1) Main.py: Creating depth based images of Universal Robotic arm model 5, using Microsoft Kinect camera in model

2) Python notebook, that has different experiments, sorry it is messy but cells can be mostly used to reproduce the research results, I will try to clean it up as I find time
